    <!-- 
        summary: -> server side validations can be added into input elements by using attributes such as
                    "required", "minlength", "maxlength", "min" and "max".
                 -> Other types of inputs like input with "type" attribute set to tel 
                    (short for telephone) only lets you enter a telephone number.
                 -> These types also include email, url etc.
                 -> We can also speicify our own pattern to check using
                    pattern attribute with it's value set to some 
                    regular expression.
